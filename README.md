# Hangman
**Description:**

*   Hangman game with romanian vocabulary from a list consisting in about 600k words.
*   Can be played both on desktop and mobile, but for a better experience I highly recommend the first option.
*   The game is a very good tool for finding out new words and what they mean by playing in its competitive environment with countdowns, levels and points.
*   At the end of each level/game you can find the meaning of the word on DEXonline.

**How to play:**

1.  You start by pressing the START button.
2.  On the top of the screen you will be able to see your current level, time for the current word and the amounts of points gathered till then.
3.  Press letters keys in order to guess one part of an random generated word.
4.  (Mobile) In case you close the keyboard, you can call it back by pressing the button from the buttom.
5.  Proceed to next level or start again by pressing again START button
